# File Combiner Desktop App Project Overview

This project is a desktop application called "combine-tool" that helps users combine multiple code files into a single text file, specifically designed for easy copying to Large Language Models (LLMs).

## What This Project Does

The application provides a **two-panel interface** that makes it easy to:

1. **Select and manage multiple code files** from different directories
2. **Preview the combined output in real-time** as files are added or removed
3. **Monitor token count** using tiktoken to ensure content fits within LLM context limits
4. **Copy combined content to clipboard** or save it to desktop as a text file

## Key Features

- **File Selection**: Multi-select file picker with duplicate prevention
- **Real-Time Preview**: Live preview of combined output with proper formatting
- **Token Counting**: GPT-4 token count display for LLM optimization
- **Smart Formatting**: Each file is wrapped in markdown code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
- **Cross-Platform Desktop App**: Built with Electron for Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Use Case

This tool is particularly useful for developers who want to:
- Share multiple code files with LLMs for code review or assistance
- Combine project files for documentation or analysis
- Prepare code context for AI pair programming sessions
- Export project snippets while staying within token limits

## Output Format

The combined files follow a structured format with file paths and properly formatted code blocks, making it easy for LLMs to understand the context and relationships between files.
